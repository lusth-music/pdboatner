To build the song, run the command 

    make

If you see this error:

    gcc  -Wall -g -o quickstart.x quickstart.c -lsong -lm 
    quickstart.c:4:26: fatal error: songlib/util.h: No such file or directory
    compilation terminated.

that means you haven't installed songlib yet. Type the commands:

    cd ..
    make install
